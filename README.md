# Shiny GreenMaps: addressing samping biases in global plant distributions

<br><br>
Welcome to *GreenMaps*, an application for explore plant distributions, species 
        richness, and endemism at various taxonomic and spatial scales without 
        requiring advanced software knowledge. Ultimately, shiny GreenMaps will 
        enhance macroecological research by providing dynamic, interactive maps 
        that can guide conservation efforts, particularly in biodiversity-rich 
        but underdocumented regions. Through shiny GreenMaps, researchers and 
        botanical collectors can better understand and target plant diversity, 
        overcoming the limitations of static maps and to steer targeted plant 
        collecting in the future.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Exploration**: Visualize species distributions across different 
regions and taxonomic levels.
- **Interactive Maps**: Navigate through interactive maps that 
adjust to your selected parameters.
- **Conservation Support**: Identify areas rich in plant diversity and 
endemism, helping direct conservation efforts.
- **No Advanced Software Needed**: Easily explore macroecological data 
without requiring expertise in GIS or coding.

### Installation Guide

To install and run **GreenMaps**, follow the steps below using R:

```R
# Install the 'devtools' package if you don't have it already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install GreenMaps from GitHub
devtools::install_github("darunabas/greenmaps")

# Load the GreenMaps library
library(greenmaps)

# Run the application
run_GreenMaps()
```

### How It Works
Once installed, **GreenMaps** provides an easy-to-use interface where you can:

- Explore plant species distribution across selected regions.
- Analyze patterns of species richness and endemism.
- We hope **GreenMaps** will become an invaluable tool in understanding and preserving global plant biodiversity.
