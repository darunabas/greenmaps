Description: Despite the importance of understanding plant distributions in 
        ecological and conservation investigations, prevailing biases and gaps 
        in the data can impair accurate biodiversity assessments. The recent 
        surge in plant occurrence data, aggregated in databases like the Global 
        Biodiversity Information Facility, has enabled large-scale biodiversity 
        analyses. Species distribution models (SDMs) can predict plant 
        occurrences in unsurveyed areas but often rely on biased data, 
        leading to inaccurate estimates of plant diversity. To address this, 
        our team developed high-resolution (10-km) native range maps for 
        201,681 vascular plant species across the globe, using an innovative 
        approach that integrates SDMs, dispersal rates, and natural habitats. 
        These "GreenMaps" reveal unique patterns of plant diversity and 
        identify cryptic hotspots that may guide future collection efforts. 
        To make this powerful tool accessible to non-specialists, we 
        introduce "shiny GreenMaps," an interactive web-based application. 
        Shiny GreenMaps enables users to explore plant distributions, species 
        richness, and endemism at various taxonomic and spatial scales without 
        requiring advanced software knowledge. Ultimately, shiny GreenMaps will 
        enhance macroecological research by providing dynamic, interactive maps 
        that can guide conservation efforts, particularly in biodiversity-rich 
        but underdocumented regions. Through shiny GreenMaps, researchers and 
        botanical collectors can better understand and target plant diversity, 
        overcoming the limitations of static maps and to steer targeted plant 
        collecting in the future.
